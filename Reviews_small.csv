"A beautiful little bar with an exciting ""martini"" list - do step outside your comfort zone and try one of the crafted drinks.

"Came here with some friends and experienced sub-par food and terrible service. First of all, the food came out really slow for a mid afternoon lunch and hardly any customers. Second, there was a really long hair coiled around a fried dumpling just under the skin and was clearly visible from the outside. I called over the waitress to bring it to her attention and she simply grabbed the plate and left. There was no apology or acknowledgement of the tainted food. We weren't sure if she was going to bring us a new batch or comp the charge so we just ended up waiting for an eternity before she came back.She brought three new dumplings, but my group was too disgusted with the food and the service to even look at them. We asked for the check and another lady (I assume a manager) came to speak with us. She asked us if everything was okay and if there were any problems. She made it seem like the hair incident hadn't been brought to her attention so I mentioned that there was a hair in our food. She rudely answered that she already knew this. So...why did you ask us if we had any problems if you already knew about the issue Nevertheless, she gave us a thoughtless, mechanical apology and comped us for only one of the two orders of dumplings even though we didn't eat either of the orders.All in all, I was extremely disappointed in the way they handled the situation and I will definitely not be back.

"Can't believe there are many reviews after my first one years ago. To be honest, I don't go there any more for few reasons. 1. The owner has changed2. The foods quality has changed3. Service is NOT as good as it used to be. 4. The original chief seem to be long gone. 5. Found a better places to have the best DIM SUM in Chandler AZOnce very satisfied customer is no longer their customer. If you want real good Chinese foods and restaurant services, go somewhere else. I guess I will never know how good their foods now. Don't even want to try.

"Decor is nice, but it was a 25 minute wait to get in, and the food was only so-so. Way too expensive for the actual quality. Recommendation: Get off the Strip and try out Chinatown or somewhere else. Not worth the wait.

"Dim Sum here is terrible.  Charlotte does not have enough competition for Dim Sum.  I used to live in Atlanta.  I enjoyed the dim sum houses there.  I grade Dim Houses with a curve in Charlotte.  I am not expecting them to be as good as Atlanta.  Even with a curve, the dim sum is terrible.     I went on a weekend.  Many of the dumplings were obviously frozen and not fresh.  Dim Sum was very heavy as well.  I only ordered steam items and a few pan fried items.  However, I had a real full stomach.  I was not feeling good at all.  I did not even eat much.  The dim sum was flavorless and greasy.   If you live in Charlotte, go to China Delight in Atlanta to get good dim sum.

"Do not get the spare ribs with black bean sauce unless you are more adventurousinsane. It was a gelatinous surprise. I wasn't sure what part of the animal I was really eating. It did not come out in rib form, it was all hacked and thrown together. It was honestly ghastly. I tried a bite. Nope, but still politely paid for it. O the quiet dissonance. Google image spare ribs. Yeah, I thought it would at least resemble that-obviously smaller- with a different sauce. *After re googling ""chinese spare ribs"" I am a bit alarmed at how different my dish was from all of the images that showed up. The sauce was described as black bean but came out clear and mucus like. Black bean was a really misleading image.The glass they brought my drink in was not clean. I mean, it was really not clean.  Skinlip gloss. Lip residue. I asked if I could have a drink in a can and they just brought me the same drink in another glass.The chicken and pork steamed buns here had a mold looking residue on the paper beneath them. I still ate it for some reason Over compensating here... Service was OK. The sanitation score is 88.5.I got some lo meinchicken dish to go and the entire time I was convinced the chicken they used was uterus. It was in these weird, long, thin strips, that sort of curled. They had these strange indentations all through out one side of the chicken. I feel like a jerk writing this, but what is that meat Throw some white chicken breast in that instead and it would be wonderful. The noodles were wonderful, the meat was sketchy. Yet, I still ate it.This seems to be a neighborhood favorite place for some reason

"Great food and atmosphere.  Very upscale and friendly.  Favorite is the kick-ass filet for dinner.  Great lunch specials too.

"I came here before a pirates game, so it was around 5:30ish or so in the evening, we had just gotten lucky that they had a table open before all there reservations for the night started to come in.  I ordered the chicken jerk sandwich with a side salad, absolutely loved it!  The chicken had the perfect amount of spice to it which was off set with sweet with the pineapple chutney it had on it, sooo good!  The salad was even great because they used real green spring mix instead of iceburg lettuce.  I also loved that they put feta cheese on top, its one of my favorite cheeses for salad topping!  Service was great here and even though I didn't have a drink here that night I have a previous time and they are yummy!  Love this place and can't wait for my next visit!
